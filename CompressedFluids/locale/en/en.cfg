[entity-name]
fluid-compressor=Compressor
fluid-decompressor=Expander

[entity-description]
fluid-compressor=Pressurize fluids to allow a higher flowrate.
fluid-decompressor=Depressurize fluids to a workable pressure for manufacturing.

[item-group-name]
compressed-fluids=High pressurized fluids

[fluid-name]
compressed-fluid=High-pressurized __1__

[technology-name]
fluid-compressor=Fluid compressor

[technology-description]
fluid-compressor=Pressurize fluids to increase throughput in pipes.

[mod-setting-name]
fluid-compression-rate=Compression rate
fluid-compression-speed=Compression speed
fluid-compressor-singeEntity=Merge (de)compressor
fluid-compressor-manual-recipes=Allow manual setting the recipe
fluid-compressor-hide-recipes=Hide (de)compressor recipes from player menu

[mod-setting-description]
fluid-compression-rate=How much fluid is required to make 1 pressurized fluid unit.
fluid-compression-speed=How much pressurized fluid is crafted at once (10 crafts / seconds).
fluid-compressor-singeEntity=If checked, this will merge the compressor and decompressor into a single entity.
fluid-compressor-manual-recipes=If checked, you have to select the fluid, this will take advantage of the no fluid mixing feature (for empty pipes).
fluid-compressor-hide-recipes=If checked, this will hide the (de)compressor recipes from the players crafting menu (always hidden if the manual recipes setting is not checked).
